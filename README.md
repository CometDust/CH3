Bootstrap 2.3.2 + Tumblr Theme = :smile: :rocket:
================================

About:
------

I'm creating this project in hopes of better understanding how to use github and familiarize myself with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/). Although 3.0 is already out I saw it fitting to still use 2.3.2. This is a learning project more than anything and if you expect to find a full-fledged Bootstrap Tumblr theme I suggest you go [here](https://github.com/mikejarema/bootstrap-tumblr-theme). My goal is to create something similar to that, this repo is just the "journey" there, I guess. This project is basically to build a Tumblr theme for my personal blog. I'm uploading it here for anyone to use if they like it.


License:
--------

As expected I will release this project under the [Apache License](https://github.com/CometDust/CH3/blob/master/LICENSE) because at its core it is Bootstrap. It only seemed fitting as I'm just mashing Tumblr's [markup](http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes) with Bootstrap.
